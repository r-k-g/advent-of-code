## Advent of Code (solutions and library)

The library symlinks situation is a bit iffy... that being said, here is how to do it
1. Be on Windows 10
2. admin cmd
3. navigate to folder you want lib in
4. `mklink /D lib "..\..\lib"`

This is mostly for my own referenceâ€”I have forgotten how to do this and had to relearn with no great online resources several times.

### The solutions
Sometimes I clean them up after the initial solve, sometimes I don't. Look at your own risk :)
